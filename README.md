# IREB ToDo Application

A modern, responsive ToDo application that demonstrates AI-assisted software development practices and requirements engineering within the IREB AI Special Interest Group (IREB AI SIG). This project serves dual purposes: delivering a fully functional task management application while showcasing the impact of AI on software development processes.

## Project Overview

This project explores AI-assisted software development and requirements engineering through the creation of a production-ready ToDo application. Built using pure web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript), it demonstrates modern development practices, clean architecture, and user-centered design principles while serving as a practical example of AI-human collaboration in software engineering.

### Dual Purpose
1. **Functional Application**: A complete, production-ready task management tool with modern UX
2. **AI Development Demonstration**: Showcase of AI-assisted development methodology and requirements engineering practices

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Complete CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete todos
- ‚úÖ **State Persistence** - localStorage integration with error handling
- ‚úÖ **Smart Filtering** - View all, active, or completed todos
- ‚úÖ **Bulk Operations** - Clear all completed todos at once
- ‚úÖ **Inline Editing** - Double-click or button to edit todo text
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates** - Live counter showing remaining active todos

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grogers99/IREB-ToDoApp-Test.git
   cd IREB-ToDoApp-Test
   ```

2. **Open the application**
   ```bash
   # Open directly in browser
   open todo-app/index.html
   
   # Or serve locally (optional)
   cd todo-app
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start using**
   - Type a task in the input field
   - Press Enter or click "Add" to create your first todo
   - Click the circle to mark todos as complete
   - Use filter buttons to view different todo states
