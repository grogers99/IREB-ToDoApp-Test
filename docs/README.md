- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and modern elements
- **CSS3** - Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - ES6+ features, classes, and modern APIs
- **localStorage API** - Client-side data persistence

### Key JavaScript Features
- Object-oriented design with ES6 classes
- Event delegation for dynamic content
- Local storage with error handling

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Modern gradient backgrounds

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4facfe;
    --secondary-color: #00f2fe;
    --accent-color: #667eea;
}
```

### Adding Features
The modular JavaScript structure makes it easy to extend:
- Add new todo properties (priority, due date, etc.)
- Implement categories or tags
- Add drag-and-drop reordering
- Integrate with external APIs

## Performance

- **Lightweight** - No external dependencies
- **Fast Loading** - Minimal file sizes
- **Efficient Rendering** - Smart DOM updates
- **Offline Ready** - Works without internet connection

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast ratios
- Focus indicators
