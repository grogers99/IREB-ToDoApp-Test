# Project Brief: IREB ToDo Application

## Project Overview
This is a project to prototype solutions for a ToDo application, that also serves to explore AI-assisted software development practices and requirements engineering. It aims to develop a modern, responsive application built that demonstrates clean architecture, modern web development practices, and user-centered design principles.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete todos
- **State Management**: Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- **Data Persistence**: Save todos to localStorage for session continuity
- **Filtering**: View all, active, or completed todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Clear all completed todos at once
- **Real-time Updates**: Live counter showing remaining active todos

### Technical Requirements
- **Pure Web Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features, classes, and modern APIs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach, works on all device sizes
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Lightweight, fast loading, efficient rendering

### User Experience Requirements
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern design with clear visual hierarchy
- **Smooth Interactions**: Animations and transitions for better UX
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter to add, Escape to cancel, double-click to edit
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear states for completed/active todos
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and storage errors

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Demonstrate Modern Web Development with AI**: Showcase best practices for AI-assisted software development and requirements engineering
2. **Create Reusable Patterns**: Establish patterns for similar applications
3. **Ensure Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and extensible code
4. **Optimize User Experience**: Fast, responsive, and intuitive interface

### Secondary Goals
1. **Educational Value**: Serve as a reference for AI-assisted web development
2. **Performance Benchmark**: Demonstrate efficiency of pure web technologies
3. **Accessibility Standard**: Meet modern accessibility requirements
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Work consistently across browsers and devices

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All CRUD operations work flawlessly
- ✅ Data persists between browser sessions
- ✅ Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- ✅ Smooth animations enhance user experience
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility is fully functional
- ✅ Code is clean, documented, and maintainable

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Core todo functionality (CRUD operations)
- Local storage persistence
- Responsive design and animations
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- Filter and bulk operations
- Clean, modern UI design

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Cloud synchronization
- Advanced features (due dates, priorities, categories)
- Offline service worker implementation
- Data export/import functionality
- Drag-and-drop reordering

## Technical Constraints
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript only
- **Browser Storage Only**: localStorage for persistence
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend or server requirements
- **Modern Browser Support**: Focus on current browser versions
- **Single Page Application**: All functionality in one HTML file

## Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, well-commented code
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance where applicable
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and code comments
